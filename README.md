# MpraVAE
A deep generative model to augment genetic variants sample size, enhancing the prediction of regulatory variants in non-coding regions built on top of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Introduction
Predicting the functional impact of genetic variants in non-coding regions is challenging. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can test thousands of variants for allele-specific regulatory activity, but typically only identify a few hundred labelled variants, limiting their use for genome-wide prediction. 

MpraVAE, a deep generative model, addresses this limitation by augmenting the training sample size of labelled variants. Benchmarking on multiple MPRA datasets shows that MpraVAE significantly improves the prediction of regulatory variants compared to conventional data augmentation methods and existing scoring techniques. Taking autoimmune diseases as one example, MpraVAE enabled genome-wide de novo prediction of regulatory variants, revealing their enrichment in enhancers, active histone marks, immune-related cell types, and key regulatory sites. These variants also facilitated the discovery of immune-related genes through integration with PCHi-C and DNase-seq data, highlighting MpraVAE's importance in genetic and gene discovery for complex traits.
